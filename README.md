# Football-match-Acquisition-Extraction-Labelling
Python-based project focused on the analysis of a football game video. This project stands out due to its emphasis on extracting individual images from the video and utilizing computer methods to enhance understanding. By employing various sets of instructions, I selectively highlighted crucial aspects of the game. In this endeavour, I employed a technique termed "RGB analysis" to create two distinct versions of the images one to showcase the yellow team and another to emphasize the blue team. Furthermore, I devised a solution to exclusively display the white lines on the field, including the central circle. This project serves as a testament to my proficiency in Python programming, image manipulation, and video analysis. It underscores my capacity to tackle challenges creatively while working with images and data. Through this project, I showcased my ability to apply technical skills to extract valuable insights from visual content.
